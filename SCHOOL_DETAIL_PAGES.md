### Slug Generation

The slug generation system converts school names into URL-friendly strings:

```typescript
// Examples:
"Sydney Boys High School" ‚Üí "sydney-boys-high-school"
"St. Mary's Primary School" ‚Üí "st-marys-primary-school"
"Newtown High School of the Performing Arts" ‚Üí "newtown-high-school-of-the-performing-arts"
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: Pages are statically generated with 1-hour revalidation
- **Static Path Generation**: All school paths are pre-generated at build time
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading and responsive images
- **Code Splitting**: Components are dynamically imported when needed
- **Caching**: API responses are cached with appropriate headers

### Error Handling

- **404 Pages**: Custom not-found pages for missing schools
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during data fetching
- **Graceful Degradation**: Components handle missing data gracefully
- **API Fallbacks**: Multiple data source fallbacks

## Usage Examples

### Direct Access
```
https://nswschools.com.au/schools/sydney-boys-high-school
https://nswschools.com.au/schools/bondi-beach-public-school
```

### Programmatic Access
```typescript
import { generateSlug, findSchoolBySlug } from '@/utils/slug';
import { fetchCompleteSchoolData } from '@/utils/api';

// Generate slug from school name
const slug = generateSlug('Sydney Boys High School');
// Result: "sydney-boys-high-school"

// Fetch school data by slug
const school = await fetchCompleteSchoolData(slug);
```

### Integration with Existing Pages

The new slug-based pages are integrated with the existing school table:

```typescript
// In SchoolTable component
<Link href={`/schools/${generateSlug(school.School_name)}`}>
  Shareable Link
</Link>
```

## SEO Benefits

2. **Social Sharing**: Rich previews when shared on social media
3. **Search Engine Optimization**: Structured data and meta tags
4. **User Experience**: Easy to remember and share URLs
5. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real MySchool API Integration**: Replace placeholder data with actual API calls
2. **User Reviews**: Add school review and rating system
3. **Comparison Tool**: Allow users to compare multiple schools
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter schools by various criteria
5. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
6. **Analytics**: Track user engagement and popular schools

## Maintenance

- **Data Updates**: School data is automatically updated via ISR

- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor Core Web Vitals and user experience metrics
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor for API failures and user errors

## Testing

Run the slug generation test:
